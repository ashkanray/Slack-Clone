## Introduction

Leveraged React to display channels, replies, and message threads. 
For any ISSUES, please refresh the page - there may be some delay.


How to run it?
install all needed packages pip install -r requirements.txt

create local database

## How to Run 
open your mysql database with mysql -u root -p
run the files in DBMigration to create tables
change the DB_NAME, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD to your database in secrets.cfg
run the following code to start the project on port 5000 python -m flask run -p 5000


## Features
Belay lets users send and read real-time chat messages that are organized into rooms called Channels. Users see a list of all the channels on the server and can click one to enter that channel. Inside, they see all the messages posted to that channel by any user, and can post their own messages. All messages belong to a channel and all channels are visible to all users
Channel names are unique strings of numbers, letters, and underscores (and no spaces). Any user can create a new channel, and the user who created a channel can delete it and all messages.
Like Slack, messages may be threaded as Replies in response to a message in a channel. Messages in the channel will display how many replies they have if that number is greater than zero. Like in Slack, clicking will open the reply thread alongside the current messages in the channel, changing the screen from a 2-column layout to a 3-column layout. We don't support nested threads; messages either belong directly to a channel or are replies in a thread to a message that does, but replies can't have nested replies of their own.
Like Slack, if a message contains any URLs that point to valid image formats, display the images in the chat at the bottom of the message. Unlike Slack, we won't support uploading images from the user's computer.
The channel display shows the number of unread messages in each channel (so somewhere you'll have to track the id of the most recent message a user has seen in each channel).
Belay should use responsive styling to render reasonably in a phone browser. In particular, on mobile devices, when a user is not in a channel they should see the list of channels, and when they are in a channel or in a thread they should see just the messages in that channel or thread, with some menu element to let them return to the channel list.
Users should have a display name and an email address, and be able to update either in the app. Users authenticate with their email address and a password, and can reset a lost password by having Belay send them a magic link.
Belay is a single-page web application. We serve a single HTML request on load and do not refresh the page. As users navigate to a channel, the application updates the navigation bar to reflect what channel they are in, and navigating to the URL for a specific channel opens the single-page application with that channel open.
Belay automatically sends non-blocking requests to the server to check for new channels and new messages in a channel. Like Slack, when it finds new messages in a channel, it displays a notification to users in that channel without moving the existing messages on the page. Users may click on the notification to load the new messages.
